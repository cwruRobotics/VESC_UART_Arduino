# Overview
This project is an implementation of [this code](https://github.com/vedderb/bldc_uart_comm_stm32f4_discovery) ported to Arduino. I followed Benjamin Vedder's tutorial on [using UART with the VESC](http://vedder.se/2015/10/communicating-with-the-vesc-using-uart/). I added minor changes only where necessary. This code is intended to run on an Arduino Due.
